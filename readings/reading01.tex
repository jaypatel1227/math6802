\maketitle

Welcome to Math 6802, a second course in algebraic topology.  In your
previous course, you discovered homology, and in this term, we focus
on its algebraic dual, \textit{co}homology.  Perhaps dualizing doesn't
seem to matter so much, but a surprise is that cohomology has rather
nicer properties than homology; for example, the cohomology groups
together form a ring!  With the theme of duality, we'll also meet
Poincar\'e duality.  We have an exciting next few months in front of
us!

For this week, from Hatcher's \textit{Algebraic Topology}, read
\textsection 2.2 Computations and Applications.  I believe you studied
the Mayer-Vietoris sequences in Autumn 2021, but perhaps not cellular
homology.  Moreover, I believe you have not yet discussed those snekay
$K(G,1)$ spaces and the relationship between $H_1$ and $\pi_1$.  A
goal for our first week is to review some homology, but also
understand what shape this course should take.  I encourage you to let
me know what direction you want to see us head in.
